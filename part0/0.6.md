    Note right of browser: The browser sends a POST request in the form of application/json. The json incldues the note content and timestamp of the current date. 
    The JS code fetched from the server uses an eventhandler to prevent the default get request of the HTML page. 
    It insteads adds the new note to the list, re renders the page and sends a POST request to the server. 

    Note right of server: The server parses the json request and saves the new note and timestamp.
